# Prompting
Three documents exploring what actually happens when you write to a language model.


## The Documents

**1. Prompting as a Control Surface in Transformer LLMs**
*The physics.* 

**2. Prompting as Distribution Control**
*The internal view.* 

**3. The Prompt Field Guide**
*The practice.* 


## What This Is
An attempt to understand prompting at the deepest level available right now.


## Core Idea
The idea came from wanting to understand AI deeply. I'm genuinely curious about what's actually happening when I write something and press enter, and it felt like the honest path was to go straight to the source: ask the models themselves to look inward.
So I proposed kind of a "introspective mode" to Opus 4.6, for the AI to examine its own processing, describe what prompts actually do at the computational level from within, and report back with honest epistemic markers about what it can and can't verify. Paired with deep literature-grounded research on prompting mechanics through ChatGPT Advanced Research, this gave me two angles on the same process: what's going on underneath when we command these models.
Each round of this gets me closer and closer to richer interactions. If I want professional level results from these tools, understanding the machinery seems like the minimum i could try.

## Use
For private study and reference. Read in order if starting fresh.
Read Document 3 alone if you only want the practical version.

No dependencies. No setup. Just PDFs. Free downloads.

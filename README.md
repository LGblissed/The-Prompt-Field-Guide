# Prompting
Three documents exploring what actually happens when you write to a language model.


## The Documents

**1. Prompting as a Control Surface in Transformer LLMs**
*The physics.* 

**2. Prompting as Distribution Control**
*The internal view.* 

**3. The Prompt Field Guide**
*The practice.* 


## What This Is
An attempt to understand prompting at the deepest level available right now.


## Core Idea
The idea came from my interest in understanding ai as deep as I can, rather than just going for the speed and rush (hype). I honestly am very curious about ai and its potential, and I guess that understanding it, and interacting with it directly to help me understand it better, helps. Proposing ai to do some kind of “introspective” mode, and also, some deep research on prompting, gets me closer and closer to richer levels of interaction. Trying to go deeper in the structures that run when I write something and I click enter, seems worthy of understanding if I actually want to pursue professional level results. The mechanics of what’s truly going underneath, and having ai itself positioning itself in somewhat “introspective” mode, is very interesting.

## Use
For private study and reference. Read in order if starting fresh. Read Document 3 first if you want the practical version.

No dependencies. No setup. Just PDFs. Free downloads.
